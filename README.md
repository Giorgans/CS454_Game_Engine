# CS454 - 2D Game Engine
---------------------------------
```
--- Description ---
2D Game Engine written in C++ with the Allegro 5 library and created as a CMake Project.
The description of the project wants to create a level from "Zelda II: The Adventures of Link"
but the engine is as generic as possible considering the time available to be developed.
