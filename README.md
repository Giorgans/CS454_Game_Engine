# CS454 - 2D Game Engine
---------------------------------
```

2D Game Engine writen in C++ with the Allegro 5 library and created as a CMake Project.
The description of the project want to create a level from "Zelda II: The Adventures of Link"
but the engine is as generic as possible considering the time available for this to be developed.
